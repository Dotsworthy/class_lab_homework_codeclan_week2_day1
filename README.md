# CodeClan homework for week 2 day 1
based on the following brief:

## Classes Lab / Homework
In this lab, we'd like you to make some classes of your own. Below we've outlined a few scenarios to be modelled as classes. Throughout each part stick to using our Test Driven Development process of writing our tests first then writing our methods and refactoring until they pass. Make sure you create two files for each class: one test file and one class file (do not put different classes in the same file).

1. Create a class called Student that takes in a name (String) and a cohort (string - e.g "E18", "G6", etc) when an new instance is created.
2. Create a couple of Getter methods, one that returns the name property and one that returns the cohort property of the student.
3. Add in Setter methods to update the students name and what cohort they are in.
4. Create a method that gets the student to talk (eg. Returns "I can talk!).
5. Create a method that takes in a students favourite programming language and returns it as part of a string (eg. student1.say_favourite_language("Ruby") -> "I love Ruby").
6. Make a class to represent a Team that has the properties Team name (String), Players (array of strings) and a Coach (String).
7. For each property in the class make a getter method than can return them.
8. Create a setter method to allow the coach's name to be updated.
9. Refactor the class to use attr_reader or attr_accessor instead of your own getter and setter methods.
10. Create a method that adds a new player to the players array.
11. Add a method that takes in a string of a player's name and checks to see if they are in the players array.
12. Add a points property into your class that starts at 0.
13. Create a method that takes in whether the team has won or lost and updates the points property for a win.
